Ultra-lightweight Container image (<170 KB uncompressed) with an elegant celebration webpage featuring animated confetti explosions.

![Screenshot](./img/screenshot.png)

This image is designed for basic container operation verification, demonstrating:

* The host system can run containers.
* Images can be successfully retrieved from the docker.io registry.
* Containers can be created without errors.
* The container can serve HTTP content, confirming network functionality.

**Container image:**

```text
docker.io/cyclenerd/it-works:latest
```

**Multiarch support:**

* `amd64` : Intel or AMD 64-Bit CPU (x86-64)
* `arm64` : Arm-based 64-Bit CPU (i.e. Apple silicon, AWS Graviton, Ampere Altra, Google Axion)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Pull and run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 "docker.io/cyclenerd/it-works:latest"

# Access in browser
# http://localhost:8080
```

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cyclenerd/it-works.git
cd it-works

# Build the Container image
docker build --tag "it-works:latest" .

# Run the Container
docker run -p 8080:8080 "it-works:latest"
```
